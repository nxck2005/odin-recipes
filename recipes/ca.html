        <li>Add the pasta and cook as the package describes, usually 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1/2 of the cooking water, drain well, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet.</li>
        <li>Once it't shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and leave undisturbed for 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the bottom is golden brown, flip over and add in 1 tbsp of butter between them, and pick up the pan and give it a gentle swirl.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 165F.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut into 1/2-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add butter and cream.</li>
        <li>Whisk until butter has melted.</li>
        <li>Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3-4 minutes. Do not boil!</li>
        <li>Whisk constantly while you do, until it starts to thicken.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>If sauce is too thick, add the reserved pasta cooking water a few tablespoons at a time to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
